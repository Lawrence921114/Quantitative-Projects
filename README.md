# Quantitative Research & Trading Projects
A collection of research-driven quantitative finance projects integrating mathematical modeling, algorithmic execution, and statistical validation.
Each project emphasizes interpretability, robustness, and real-world market application.

Key Focus Areas
	•	Market Microstructure & Order-Book Analysis — development of high-frequency indicators such as maker–taker ratio, order-flow imbalance, and queue dynamics to model liquidity pressure and short-term price impact.
	•	Statistical & Factor Modeling — signal generation via cross-sectional and time-series factor analysis (momentum, volatility carry, value spreads), including factor orthogonality testing and performance attribution.
	•	Algorithmic Strategy Research — event-driven backtesting frameworks for intraday and medium-frequency trading, emphasizing execution efficiency and latency-sensitive decision rules.
	•	Machine Learning Integration — implementation of supervised and unsupervised models (random forests, PCA, clustering) to enhance signal filtering and portfolio optimization while preserving interpretability.
	•	Risk & Portfolio Management — Monte-Carlo simulations, Kelly-criterion sizing, and dynamic hedging strategies using stochastic process frameworks.Key Focus Areas
