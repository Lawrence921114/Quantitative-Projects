# Quantitative Research & Trading Projects
A curated collection of research-driven quantitative finance projects integrating market microstructure modeling, statistical signal research, and algorithmic execution.
Each study emphasizes interpretability, robustness, and real-world applicability under the principles of rigorous data science and trading intuition.

Key Focus Areas:
- Market Microstructure & Order-Book Analysis â€” development of high-frequency indicators such as makerâ€“taker ratio, order-flow imbalance, and queue dynamics to model liquidity pressure and short-term price impact.
- Statistical & Factor Modeling â€” signal generation via cross-sectional and time-series factor analysis (momentum, volatility carry, value spreads), including factor orthogonality testing and performance attribution.
- Algorithmic Strategy Research â€” event-driven backtesting frameworks for intraday and medium-frequency trading, emphasizing execution efficiency and latency-sensitive decision rules.
- Risk & Portfolio Management â€” Monte-Carlo simulations, Kelly-criterion sizing, dynamic programming algorithmn for portfolio optimization, and dynamic hedging strategies using stochastic process frameworks.

ðŸ“ˆ Recent Work (Kronos Research Quantitative Trading Program) : 
- Research extensions under the Kronos Research Quantitative Trading Program, focusing on high-frequency order-book datasets and sub-second liquidity modeling.
- Topics include market impact estimation, execution-strategy optimization, and API-driven tick-level data research supervised by professional HFT traders.
